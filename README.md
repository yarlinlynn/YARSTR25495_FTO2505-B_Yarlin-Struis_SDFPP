# Personal Resume Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal resume website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background as a web developer. The website is built using HTML and CSS, with a focus on clean design, and responsive layouts to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

The resume highlights my expertise in front-end development, including proficiency in creating visually appealing interfaces and implementing responsive design principles. It serves as a central hub for potential employers, clients, or collaborators to explore my work and get in touch.
