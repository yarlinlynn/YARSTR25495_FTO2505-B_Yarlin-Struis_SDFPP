# 🧠 Suggested Presentation Structure


### 🟢 1. **Introduction (30 seconds – 1 min)**
**Say:**
- Your name
- What this project is and what you learned from building it
- One thing you're proud of

💬 *Example:*  
"Hi, I’m Sam, and this is my resume project built with HTML and CSS. This project taught me how to structure a real-world site from a design file, and I’m especially proud of how closely I matched the layout in the Figma."

---

### 🟢 2. **Walkthrough of the Resume (2–3 minutes)**
**Share your screen and open your Resume in the browser.**

Go section by section and explain:
- What content is shown  
- How you structured it in your HTML  
- Any cool styling or responsive features you added  

🎯 **Talk through these key sections:**
- Profile & Summary → What does your summary say? Why did you write it that way?  
- Proficiency Bars → How did you build them and style the widths?  
- Skills Tags → How did you choose these, and how did you make them look neat?  
- Projects → Pick one and explain what you did  
- Education & Experience → Any choices you made in how to show this?  
- Footer → Show that your links work (email, GitHub, LinkedIn)

💡 *Tip:* Don’t just describe what we can already see — explain the **why** behind your layout and styling.

---

### 🟢 3. **Responsiveness Demo (30 seconds)**
**Resize your browser** to show how the layout changes for mobile.

Say:
- What you used to make it responsive (media queries, flexbox, grid etc.)
- Any sections you found tricky to make mobile-friendly

💬 *Example:*  
"I used media queries to stack the intro image and text vertically on smaller screens, and I adjusted the padding to keep it readable."

---

### 🟢 4. **Code Overview (2–3 minutes)**
Switch to your code editor (VS Code or similar).

**Highlight the following:**
- How your HTML is structured with semantic tags  
- How you kept your CSS clean and organised  
- A specific layout challenge and how you solved it  
- Any bonus features you added (e.g. hover effects, animations)

🎯 You must show that:
- Your code is readable and well-named  
- You understand what each part of your code is doing  
- You wrote the code yourself and can explain your decisions

💡 *Tip:* You don’t need to show every line of code — just the key parts that demonstrate your understanding.

---

### 🟢 5. **Reflection (1 minute)**
**Wrap up by sharing:**
- What you found most challenging and how you overcame it  
- What you’re proud of  
- What you’d do differently next time or want to learn next

💬 *Example:*  
"Positioning the project cards was tricky at first, but I figured it out by using flexbox and checking spacing in the Figma. Next time, I want to try using grid for more complex layouts."
