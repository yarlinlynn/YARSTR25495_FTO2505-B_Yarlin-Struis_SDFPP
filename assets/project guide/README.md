# 💼 SDFPP Resume Project

Welcome to your first major **portfolio project** in the Software Development Program is a resume project (SDFPP). In this challenge, using a [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/fM2tutgIH0k1SrNir4MVe3/SDF-Resume-Project-STUDENT-REFERENCE-FILE?node-id=0-1&t=yGSXI1yv4AgjKBvA-1) as reference, you’ll create your very own online resume — a personal website that shows off your skills, experience, and code style using **HTML and CSS**.

This is not just practice — this is something you can proudly include in your portfolio and share with future employers!

## 🧪 How You’ll Be Marked

Your project will be assessed using **two components**:

### ✅ 1. Code & Layout Marking 
Each section of your resume site is scored based on:
- Use of semantic HTML and correct structure
- Accurate styling, spacing, typography, and colour matching the Figma
- Pixel accuracy for layout and alignment
- Responsive layout on mobile screens
- Clean and well-structured code
- Functional and visually polished components
- Accessibility (e.g., alt text for images and icons)

> A full breakdown of the scoring rubric is available on your Dashboard. Each feature is mapped to a clear user story and assigned a difficulty rating. Some features offer bonus points for pixel-perfection ✨

### 🎙️ 2. Recorded Presentation 
You must record a **5–10 minute** screen presentation of your project using Loom, OBS, or any screen recorder.

You will be scored on:
- How well you explain your code and decisions
- Understanding and communication of the project brief
- Visual walkthrough of your site and responsiveness
- Presentation skills (confidence, clarity, visual aids)
